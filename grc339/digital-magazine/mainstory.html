                            <h2>Every designer needs a copy of "Grid Systems in Graphic Design: A Visual Communication Manual for Graphic Designers, Typographers and Three Dimensional Designers"</h2>
                    
                                <p>In the world of graphic design, the art of visual communication is more than just creativity and aesthetics. It involves a deep understanding of the principles that underpin effective design, and one such foundational principle is the use of grid systems. A classic reference and an indispensable resource for graphic designers, typographers, and three-dimensional designers, "Grid Systems in Graphic Design: A Visual Communication Manual for Graphic Designers, Typographers and Three Dimensional Designers" by Josef Müller-Brockmann has remained a timeless guide that every designer should have on their bookshelf. </p>
                                <p>Grid systems are the invisible framework upon which graphic design is built. They provide structure, consistency, and order to visual communication. The use of grid systems is not limited to just printed materials but extends to digital design and three-dimensional design as well. By providing a systematic approach to organizing content and elements, grid systems create harmony and enhance the readability and aesthetics of design.</p>

                                <p>Published in 1981, Josef Müller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" has had a profound and lasting impact on the field of design. Müller-Brockmann, a Swiss graphic designer and educator, was a pioneer in the use of grid systems. His work exemplifies the modernist design principles of clarity, simplicity, and objectivity.</p>

                                <p>The book is a comprehensive manual that not only explains the theory behind grid systems but also provides practical guidelines and numerous examples to demonstrate their application. Müller-Brockmann's insights and teachings are based on his extensive experience and mastery of the subject, making this book a cornerstone in design education.</p>

                                <p>This book is a compelling testament to the perpetual relevance of design fundamentals in a field that is ever-evolving. In a design landscape that's continually shifting, Müller-Brockmann's work remains a steadfast pillar of knowledge and a trusted foundation for excellence in graphic design, typography, and three-dimensional design. It's a blueprint that ensures your creative work is anchored in the bedrock of structural precision and clarity, ensuring that your design stands the test of time.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Coign — released in December 2018 — is an extensive study of condensed forms based on the DeLittle type foundry’s Elongated Sans. Borrowing its name from letterpress printing terminology, Coign brings DeLittle’s ideas firmly into the 21st century, applying the systematic thinking of Adrian Frutiger’s Univers to create a comprehensive and cohesive family with a large range of weights and widths.
