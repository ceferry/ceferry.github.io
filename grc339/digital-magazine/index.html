                                <p>
                                    Coign — released in December 2018 — is an extensive study of condensed forms based on the DeLittle type foundry’s Elongated Sans. Borrowing its name from letterpress printing terminology, Coign brings DeLittle’s ideas firmly into the 21st century, applying the systematic thinking of Adrian Frutiger’s Univers to create a comprehensive and cohesive family with a large range of weights and widths.(by colophon-foundry.org)                               </p>

                                    Apta began as a typographic study inspired by vernacular signage adorning mid-century social housing estates in Islington, North London. The estate names are set in elegant, mono-linear, sans serif capitals in white on cobalt blue, vitreous enamel tiles and are framed by red brick and inset flush to the exterior walls (by colophon-foundry.org).                             </p>

                                    Selecting a typeface that improves legibility and readability is crucial for making written content accessible to individuals with visual impairments, learning disabilities, aphasia, dyslexia, or low adult literacy. Typefaces are the foundation of accessible reading experiences, ensuring your written information is as inclusive as possible.
